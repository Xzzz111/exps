Impact info
Information Disclosure

Affected component(s)
MachineKeyController (orion-ops-api/orion-ops-web/src/main/java/cn/orionsec/ops/controller/MachineKeyController.java), FileDownloadServiceImpl (orion-ops-api/orion-ops-service/src/main/java/cn/orionsec/ops/service/impl/FileDownloadServiceImpl.java)

Attack vector(s)
Any authenticated user can call /orion/api/machine-key/list, retrieve key IDs, request a download token via /orion/api/file-download/token, and fetch the referenced SSH key through /orion/api/file-download/{token}/exec without authorization checks.

Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info
The Orion-ops automation platform exposes its machine key APIs to all authenticated users. Because the download token flow never validates ownership, any low-privilege account can enumerate key IDs and download every SSH private key that administrators imported, resulting in complete disclosure of stored credentials.

Additional information
No patch is available as of commit 5925824997a3109651bbde07460958a7be249ed1; deployment environments should block low-privileged accounts from these endpoints until authorization checks are added.
