Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info
Scada-LTS before commit 1cfaed4b35117e4871bc3dfeae073f61d8e3bb3d is vulnerable to a Zip Slip path traversal in the project import feature. Crafted archive entries with directory traversal sequences are written outside the intended uploads/graphics folders, allowing arbitrary file overwrite under Common.getHomeDir().

Additional information
Proof of concept: create a ZIP containing uploads/../../../../webapps/Scada-LTS/assets/logo.png with a valid PNG payload, upload it via the System → Import interface, and observe the overwritten logo file under ${Common.getHomeDir()}/webapps/Scada-LTS/assets/.
