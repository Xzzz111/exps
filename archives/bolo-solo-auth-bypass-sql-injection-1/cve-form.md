# CVE Request Form

* **Vulnerability type info**  
Authentication bypass leading to SQL injection

* **Vendor of the product(s) info**  
Bolo Blog project maintainers (https://github.com/bolo-blog)

* **Affected product(s)/code base info**  
Bolo Solo blog platform

* **Product Version**  
- Product: Bolo Solo  
  Versions: <= 4.3.4 (latest commit)  
  Fixed version: not available (no patch at disclosure time)

* **Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability**  
No

* **Attack type info**  
Remote

* **Impact info**  
Code Execution, Escalation of Privileges

* **Affected component(s)**  
`src/main/java/org/b3log/solo/processor/OAuthProcessor.java`, `src/main/java/org/b3log/solo/service/UpgradeService.java`

* **Attack vector(s)**  
Send a crafted POST request to `/oauth/bolo/login` while `UpgradeService.boloFastMigration` is true; the handler executes unauthenticated migration logic and concatenates attacker-controlled values into SQL statements, enabling admin takeover or arbitrary SQL.

* **Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info**  
"Bolo Solo through 4.3.4 exposes the fast migration endpoint `/oauth/bolo/login` without authentication whenever `UpgradeService.boloFastMigration` is set. The handler concatenates user-supplied credentials into SQL statements, allowing unauthenticated admin creation and SQL injection, which can lead to privilege escalation and arbitrary database modification."

* **Discoverer(s)/Credits info**  
sh7err@vEcho

* **Reference(s) info**  
https://github.com/bolo-blog/bolo-solo

* **Additional information**  
The issue occurs on default installations because `boloFastMigration` is automatically enabled until skins are configured, so the vulnerable endpoint is reachable immediately after deployment.
