**Attack type info**  
Remote

**Impact info**  
Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure

**Affected component(s)**  
`src/main/java/org/mybatis/jpetstore/web/actions/AccountActionBean#editAccount`, `src/main/java/org/mybatis/jpetstore/service/AccountService#updateAccount`, `src/main/resources/org/mybatis/jpetstore/mapper/AccountMapper.xml`

**Attack vector(s)**  
An unauthenticated attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/jpetstore/actions/Account.action` with the `editAccount` event and arbitrary `username`/`password`/`account.*` fields, causing the application to overwrite any account row (including its password) without authentication.

**Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info**  
MyBatis JPetStore Demo 6 through 6.1.1-SNAPSHOT allows unauthenticated account takeover because the `editAccount` action trusts user-supplied `username` and `password` parameters without checking session authentication or rebinding to the logged-in user, enabling attackers to update arbitrary accounts and reset their passwords via a single POST request.

**Additional information**  
Proof-of-concept payload: `editAccount=&username=ACID&password=Pwned123&account.firstName=Owned...` sent to `/jpetstore/actions/Account.action` returns 302 and replaces the chosen account’s password, granting the attacker full access.
