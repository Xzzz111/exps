No

Attack type info
Network

Impact info
Other (unauthorized state change via forged requests)

Affected component(s)
WebContent/WEB-INF/spring-security.xml, Scada-LTS REST endpoints relying on session authentication (e.g., /api/watch-lists, /api/reports)

Attack vector(s)
Victim browses to an attacker-controlled web page while logged into Scada-LTS; the page auto-submits a POST/PUT/DELETE form to Scada-LTS endpoints, which accept the request because CSRF protection is disabled.

Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info
Scada-LTS before commit 1cfaed4b35117e4871bc3dfeae073f61d8e3bb3d disables Spring Security's CSRF protection for all web contexts. Any attacker-controlled site can trigger authenticated browsers to execute state-changing REST requests (e.g., /api/watch-lists), resulting in unauthorized modifications performed under the victim account.
