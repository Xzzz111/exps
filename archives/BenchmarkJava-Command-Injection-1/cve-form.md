Attack type info  
Remote

Impact info  
Code Execution

Affected component(s)

Send an HTTP request containing header `BenchmarkTest00295` with shell metacharacters (e.g., `hello && id`). The servlet passes `"echo " + headerValue` as the third argument to `sh -c`/`cmd.exe /c`, allowing arbitrary commands to run under the servlet container account.

Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info  
"OWASP Benchmark for Java 1.2 exposes an unauthenticated OS command injection in `BenchmarkTest00295`, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via crafted values of the `BenchmarkTest00295` HTTP header."
