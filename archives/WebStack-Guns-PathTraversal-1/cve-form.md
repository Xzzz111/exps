## CVE Request Form — WebStack-Guns Path Traversal

* **Vulnerability type info**: Path Traversal / Arbitrary File Read (CWE-22)
* **Vendor of the product(s) info**: WebStack-Guns Project (GitHub organization jsnjfz)
* **Affected product(s)/code base info**:
  * **Product**: WebStack-Guns
  * **Version**: 1.0 (latest master). No fixed version is available at publication time.
* **Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability**: No
* **Attack type info**: Network
* **Impact info**: Information Disclosure
* **Affected component(s)**: `com.jsnjfz.manage.modular.system.controller.KaptchaController#renderPicture`, `src/main/java/com/jsnjfz/manage/config/web/ShiroConfig.java`
* **Attack vector(s)**: An unauthenticated attacker issues a crafted request such as `GET /kaptcha/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to coerce the server into reading and returning arbitrary filesystem contents from the configured upload directory.
* **Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info**: WebStack-Guns 1.0 exposes `/kaptcha/{pictureId}` as a public endpoint and concatenates the attacker-controlled `pictureId` directly with the upload directory when reading files. Because no validation or canonicalization is performed, remote attackers can traverse directories and download arbitrary files readable by the service account, leading to high-impact information disclosure.
