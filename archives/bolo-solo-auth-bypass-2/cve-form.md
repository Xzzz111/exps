Information Disclosure, Other (Content tampering / stored XSS potential)

* **Affected component(s)**  
`src/main/java/org/b3log/solo/processor/B3Receiver.java`, `src/main/java/org/b3log/solo/service/UserQueryService.java`, `src/main/java/org/b3log/solo/model/Option.java`

* **Attack vector(s)**  
Send a JSON request to `/apis/symphony/article` with `client.userB3Key` set to the default value `123456`; because the server falls back to this hard-coded secret when no custom key is configured, it accepts the request and publishes attacker-controlled articles.

* **Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info**  
"Bolo Solo through 4.3.4 uses a hard-coded default B3 synchronization key (`123456`) for the `/apis/symphony/article` endpoint when administrators do not set `b3logKey`. Because the endpoint lacks any other authentication, unauthenticated attackers can publish or overwrite articles by submitting the default key, leading to full content tampering."

* **Discoverer(s)/Credits info**  
sh7err@vEcho

* **Reference(s) info**

* **Additional information**  
The issue affects default installations because the configuration UI does not force administrators to change the key before the synchronization endpoint becomes reachable.
