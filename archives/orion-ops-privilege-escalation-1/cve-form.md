Attack type info
Remote

Impact info
Escalation of Privileges, Denial of Service

Affected component(s)
UserController (orion-ops-api/orion-ops-web/src/main/java/cn/orionsec/ops/controller/UserController.java), UserServiceImpl (orion-ops-api/orion-ops-service/src/main/java/cn/orionsec/ops/service/impl/UserServiceImpl.java)

Attack vector(s)
Any authenticated user can call /orion/api/user/update with an arbitrary "id" field and set the target account's "status" to disabled or tamper with their profile because the controller and service trust attacker-specified IDs.

Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info
In Orion-ops, the /orion/api/user/update endpoint lacks authorization and accepts attacker-controlled IDs. Non-admin users can update arbitrary accounts and disable administrators by setting their status to "disabled", resulting in horizontal privilege abuse and denial of service.

Additional information
A fix should enforce that non-admins may only update their own record and that administrator operations use dedicated, role-protected endpoints.
