Impact info
Information Disclosure

Affected component(s)
TkFiles take, src/main/java/org/takes/tk/TkFiles.java

Attack vector(s)
An unauthenticated remote attacker sends an HTTP request whose path contains traversal sequences such as `/../../etc/passwd`, causing TkFiles to resolve and stream files outside the configured document root.

Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE info
The Takes web framework's TkFiles take fails to canonicalize HTTP request paths before resolving them against the filesystem. A remote attacker can include `../` sequences in the request path to escape the configured base directory and read arbitrary files from the host system.
